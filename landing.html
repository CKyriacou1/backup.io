													<h3>The Importance of a Postgraduate Degree in the Computer Science Field</h3>
													<div class="The Importance of a Postgraduate Degree in the Computer Science Field">
<p>As the current market shifts and alters in regards to the advancement of science and it’s fields, it is natural for masters applicants to shape an opinion 
regarding this change. As one of those applicants, I have chosen to focus on a data science degree as I’ve realized that the general field of computer science is a large component 
for the growth of our current market, and I wish to be a part of this development. My assignment covers investigation into this matter, as well as highlighting the reasoning of my personal choice.
In the academic paper of Vasant Dhar, ‘Data Science and Prediction’, various academic definitions are given. It is mentioned that science is the systemic approach to acquiring knowledge.
Subsequently, data science is defined by Vasant Dharin in his article of ‘Data Science and Prediction’, as the focus of this systemic approach involving data as well as various other variables. 
These variables are defined by the author as different fields of science, as well as practices such as the systematic study of data ,regarding its properties,organization and analysis 
,translating it into reliable deductions. The author insists that data science is a field separate of the previously mentioned variables and as such sets a need in the market for employment for 
individuals that have academic or previous experience within this field specifically, different from the previously stated. As such, the term computer science can be defined as the application
of science within a computerized environment, using previously mentioned variables. It is stated in the article ‘data science and prediction’ by Vasant Dhar, that the correlation between 
these two sectors could be defined as the predictive accuracy used by computers. Consequently, it is natural to say that by using the information presented in the article, these two sectors are 
linked and specifically that one may encapsule the other as a subcategory within its own field. This article manages to formulate this connection as it states the core category to be computer science, 
as data science is stated to be the product of a surge of computer based collected data in the new age.</p> 

<p>The article used above, states that as databases expand, the constant need for education is apparent, as to handle most current matters regarding the field.
In agreement to the previous statement, there is a constant need for the educating and employment of data scientists to be able to supply with these demands. 
Regarding this, the market has influenced universities and various other establishments to employ methods to educate potential candidates for these positions.
Specifically speaking, throughout the previous article it is mentioned that the employment market for data scientists has increased within recent years
,as noted within the article ‘Bridging the demand and the offer in data science’ by Adam S.Z. Belloum, Spiros Koulouzis, Tomasz Wiktorski and Andrea Manieri.
With this in mind, I have formulated the decision of educating myself within this specific field as a means to acquiring a position in the data science field of employment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in regards to this personal decision of studying within this field, an additional reason as to why I am currently seeking to pursue a masters 
degree in this field is stated in the ‘2015 data science salary survey’, written by King, J. and Magoulas, R. ,that relays the information 
that ‘the median annual base salary for a starting data scientist is $91,000’. This information relays to my person, that attaining a position within this 
field will provide me with financial security and potential for salary growth. Additionally, these figures according to the ‘2015 data science survey’ by King, J. and Magoulas, R.
,have been consistent over time. These elements were one of the defining factors in my decision to study data science as a master’s degree. Besides the previous stated fact, 
I chose this path as it offered a fixed set of hours in most employment positions, as referred to in the article by J.King and R.Magoulas, ‘2015 data science survey’. 
This allows me to experience other opportunities outside of my employment hours, as it provides me with some time for leisure activities. 
In agreement with my previous statement, I also chose this path, as a way to further explore my abilities in programming and statistics
,as well as my passion for science and learning. Lastly, It is important to note that the prospect of new academics in the field will resort in more accurate results 
regarding the handling of large databases and thus more accurate solutions for various issues, which is referred to in the article ‘Data Science and Prediction’. 
The result of a larger pool of specialists is the insurance of outcomes with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I wish to be part of this unit of professionals, adding to the discovery and innovation within the data science field
,whilst allowing to possess all the benefits I have stated above.</p>

											<h4>Unit 1 (Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management):</h4>
											<p>Discussion Topic: Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), 
											in the context of the article by Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, 
											risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.</p>
											
<p>During the procedure of analyzing large amounts of data, usually we face many difficulties and challenges.
Processing large data sets can be very time consuming in our effort to draw the right conclusions and results. In
addition to this, the data collection sometimes can be highly constrained or highly delayed. Furthermore,
circumstances that data is sent from low latency environments by thousands of devices, make it necessary to
process at a rapid pace the data. In fact, that is the reason why proper design for the analytical procedure is
necessary to effectively manage these situations.
Furthermore, most of the times processing large quantities of data can be very challenging regarding the cost
required. In detail, a high-performance processing can be very costly mainly due to the high-power bills. However,
although low performance processing can be a good way to conserve energy usually it doesn't correspond to the
demand of the big data analysis. Therefore, it is necessarily important to apply a new architecture model to satisfy
both sectors.
The processing of large amounts of data often comes up against limitations that are usually created by the
processing of personal data. We need to be sure that all data protection laws are respected during the data analysis
process. This can be extremely challenging regarding the processing of big data. Personal data must be provided
only for specified and legitimate purposes and not for further processing that does not correspond to these purposes.
Moreover, the analysis of large amounts of data is confronted with many risks. The sources of the data can often
be unreliable, giving us the wrong information. This has as effect in the extraction of results that do not correspond to
reality, thus producing incorrect data analysis and conclusions.
Besides, a proper management of big data give us the opportunity to progress in different sectors. This is because
accurate data analysis leads to accurate decision making. Due to this fact in many areas can be achieved
development, and lay a solid foundation for advancement in science, medicine, and business.</p>

Comments: This was the first individual work that enabled us to point out the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges 
	  in relation with the data collection process. After anally examining the Lecturecast and other literature, most relevant to the topic
	 ,I managed to contribute to the discussion as follows. Following the completion of this task, I received an immense amount of information 
	  regarding the data collection process (opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges) which will present to be a very significant skill 
	  for my career afterwards, as a data scientist in which I will have to be capable of retrieving, handling large quantities of data and managing 
	  to take the correct data-driven decisions.
	
	
	
<h4>Unit 2 (Introduction to Data Types and Formats):</h4>
<p> Assignment: Considering what you have now learned in Units 1 and 2, you should respond 
                to at least three of your peers’ contributions from the Collaborative Discussion 1. 
	        To guide you, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s page (Group/Teamwork).

<p> Comments: In exploring the obligations of my master’s degree, I was called to process information provided by my peers 
	      and submit specific notes as to promote their improvement in terms of the accuracy of their written work. 
	      Additionally, in relation to the promotion of the accuracy of their work, I inherently as a response to an assignment, 
	      formulated specific questions in order to promote the retrieval of missed information produced in their written work.
	      This specific occurrence served as the first time I attempted to interact with my peers in a written manner with previously
	      formulated content. It is important to mention that these individuals were chosen to be my teammates in a group project in 
	      the Units 6 and 11 within the module. Within the aforementioned process, I read the essays of my fellow peers, and after careful 
	      consideration of their work, I formulated replies in a manner that promoted the expression of my own thoughts as for the adjustment
	      of their content for their improvement of their written content, whilst also inherently producing questions as to allow for the 
	      clarification of certain aspects unexplored within their work.

<h4>Unit 3 (Data Collection and Storage):</h4>
											
<p>Assignment: In this third and final week of your first discussion, you should provide a summary post
	       based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of Units 1, 2 and 3. 
	       Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.</p>
											
<p>As our society and our knowledge evolve, so does the way we can use data. Nowadays, the decisions of
organizations and companies are fully guided by large masses of data which are imported from different data
sources ,in order to be processed and analyzed for this purpose. The completion of this procedure , can be achieved
much more efficiently since technology and loT (internet of things) are progressing rapidly.
However, even with the rapid evolution of technology sometimes the processing and analysis of big data can be
very time-consuming and costly. Additionally, while storing our data we need to be sure that our data sources are
reliable and will lead us to the right conclusions and decisions, otherwise erroneous decisions may lead to disastrous
consequences. Furthermore, it is required that the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are fully respected
during the data collection, data storage and data analysis procedures. More precisely, data coming from various loT
devices, may contain some personal details which only certain people will be able to access. Missing and incomplete
data ,make the task of the specialist even more difficult ,since they have to keep in mind the appropriate
configuration of the data as well.
Therefore, it becomes necessary for a data scientist to take into consideration these challenges. Data needs to be
accessed timely, accurately, and efficiently. Data cleaning is a fundamental procedure which contributes in preparing
our database for processing and analysis. During this procedure, bad and irrelative data are being removed to
simplify our analysis process. At the same time, handling missing and incomplete data is a fundamental part of this
procedure which a data scientist should be aware.
Data is all around us in our everyday life. Hence, the correct harvesting and processing of data is of utmost
importance for modern companies. On the other hand, irresponsible data management can be disastrous and affect
the smooth operation of the business.</p>

Comments: Within the implications of enacting in unit 3, I was called to gather information from both units, one and two 
	  ,as to provide a summary post in regards to the posting of my initial post in unit 1 the feedback from my peers 
	  in unit 2 and lastly the implementation of the content provided in the previous and current units.
	  The objective of the specific assignment contributed to a well-rounded understanding of the matter at hand and 
	  as such gave me the material necessary to relay information about this topic.
